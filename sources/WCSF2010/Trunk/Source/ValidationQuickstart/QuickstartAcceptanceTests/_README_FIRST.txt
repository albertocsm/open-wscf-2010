The QuickstartAcceptanceTests project is here to provide the following:
 * A simple set of instructions to allow a first time user to see what the Quickstart should and should not do.
 * Show the types of test cases that the patterns & practices team uses to determine when when we are "done" with a quickstart.
 * Allow the end user to verify functionality if they choose to.

If you have Visual Studio Team System with the Test sku, the QuickstartAcceptanceTests project can be run using the Test Manager in Visual Studio.  All the tests are manual tests.
If you do not have the VSTS Test sku, the test files can be opened using Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer.
